Project SCRAMBLE was a project conducted by the SCP Foundation that aimed to create the SCRAMBLE Visor Unit, an eyepiece that would allow for Foundation units to view SCP-096's face without worry of triggering its response. This visor utilized SCRAMBLE, a program that utilizes a microprocessor within the visor to analyze the viewing field for the facial features of SCP-096. Upon recognition, it would immediately obfuscate the image before the light reaches the human eye.
